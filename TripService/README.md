# Trip Service Kata

Info: [codingdojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/TripService/)

## Problem Description

The objective is to test and refactor the legacy TripService class. The end result should be well-crafted code that expresses the domain. We do not need tests for collaborators (right now), we want to test only the logic contained in the TripService class.

# Rules

* We can’t change any existing code if not covered by tests. We can’tafford to break any existing behavior.

* The only exception is if we need to change the code to add unit tests, but in this case, just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed.
